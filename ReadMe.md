This is project of user service for my OOP course in university

 You have a system where each user (like a student in a classroom) is created by asking for their name, surname, and birthday. Each user gets a unique ID and a secure password (with uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and a number). All users are stored in a dictionary, where the ID is the key and the user object is the value.
